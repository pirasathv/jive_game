# Jive Deck app

Small app just to call BackEnd and call Deck actions.

#How it works

Follow To Install steps.
Then, open the browser on the url and you'll see the main, and only, page.
Click on 'Start Deck' to create a new deck. The deck will be created and a message 'No card' will be showed.
You can get a card or shuffle the deck (the deck is created ordered by default).
You can get the number of the cards you want and shuffle the deck whenever you want.
After getting all cards, a button 'New deck' will be showed. You can get a new one and restarted the same process.

That's it.

# To Install

Must have npm and angular-cli installed

- npm install
- ng serve --open

That's all! Just access http://localhost:4200/
