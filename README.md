# Jive Deck Application

Small system to manager a deck. This project contains the back and the front end.

# Back-end details

The back-end was building using:
- Java 8
- SpringBoot
- Lombok: You must configure the Lombok on your IDE, otherwise the code won't compile. But it's very simples, check details here https://projectlombok.org/

To start the backend, just execute the class ca.com.jive.game.config.spring.SpringStarter.java, SpringBoot will do the hard work ;)


# Some details

Some classes have Javadoc with some details of the implementation, just to explain the decisions.


# Front-end Project

The front-end is in this same repository just to make it easy here, but in this kind of projet (Angular/React/etc + REST backend), I like to but then in differents repository. The backend and the frontend can have a different lifecicle and differents versions, so it works better having then in two differents projects

For some details of the Front-end, check the README.md inside src/main/web
